# XMCD-sum-rules
Allow the import, normalisation, centring and merging of XAS/XMCD spectra from DEIMOS-SOLEIL then to automatically apply the sum rules. One scan number to give (with a Tz parameter without incidence on calculations), the next 7 should be the same sample with +/-H and circular right (CR) and left (CL).
